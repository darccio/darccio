Last Sunday I built a little robot for [Google Wave](https://wave.google.com) which allows to embed music players from [GoEar](http://www.goear.com/), [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/start) and [The Sixty One](http://thesixtyone.com): [Deciwave](https://deciwave.appspot.com/).

It was really simple, once I got the Gadget API and its inners, to be able to replace a blip with the players. When I made one player I was so amazed that I integrated all my frequent music sites.

If you want to use it, just add deciwave@appspot.com to your wave, create a new [blip](http://google.about.com/od/b/g/google_wave_blip.htm) and paste a share URL on it.
