> **Progress made:** deletion of logins.

The first easy step to end my dependence on Facebook is to delete all my websites and third-party applications logins. As I said in my previous post, I have 123 logins. And what have I found among those?

For starters, reviewing [the list](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications), most of them are websites that I know and use, so I had to go one by one, checking if they have the option to identify myself without Facebook or any other social network. Or if I no longer use them or do not interest me anymore, to delete the accounts and applications.

Before going through the different cases that I have found, in this post I want to highlight one in particular: Cosmopolitan-like tests websites. I imagine that many of us have fallen at some point in this, to laugh with someone on Facebook, like those of [QuizzStar](http://quizzstar.com/). To do so, you have to identify yourself with our Facebook account. What information do these websites usually collect?

I've looked at others, like [vonvon](https://vonvon.me/), and the permissions are identical or worse. This is a good example of the misuse we do (yes, us) of our own data, giving them away in exchange for a frivolous and funny result. Can anyone justify that the digital version of a teen magazine test needs all this? Most likely, the tests are a hook to obtain and sell personal data.

Once we understand the seriousness of the matter, the question we immediately ask ourselves is “How can I get them to delete my data?”. The answer is not simple as to delete the entry from the list but [to contact each web and application manually](https://www.facebook.com/help/149151751822041) and ask them to be removed by giving a user identifier from the same permission screen. This is insane!

*Interlude: while writing this post, Facebook has given me this reminder about the new European regulation on data protection. :facepalm:*

I want to give you an example. I have an application called [Instant Win](https://apps.facebook.com/instantlywin/?ref=br_rs). Following what is stated in the Facebook Help Center, I do:

1. I search for the application: [Instant Win](http://apps.facebook.com/instantlywin/?ref=br_rs).
2. On the page (blank) I look for a small link at the end of the right column that says “Report/Contact”.
3. I follow the wizard, indicating that I want to send a message to the developer (last option).
4. I follow the link on the next screen to send a message (sic).
5. It takes me to the [Woobox help center](http://help.woobox.com/), apparently the developer of the application.
6. I try to find a way to contact Woobox, but there is no form or address.
7. So I decide to go to the main website.
8. At the bottom of the page I find a contact address and send them the following email:

> Hello,
>
> I recently found that I used your Facebook app Instant win at some point. I do not longer use it. Please delete any data related to user ID XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and confirm.
>
> Failure to comply with this request will be reported to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, as it would be against GDPR's article 17.
>
> This request is based on the procedure provided by Facebook in its Help Center.
>
> Thanks,
> Dario

Now I have to wait. I want to believe that I have found a bad example and with others it will be different. If not, this will show the little interest that Facebook (and some websites) have in the protection of our data.
