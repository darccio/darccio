Time ago I wrote down a quick plain text file with the main "rules" about achieving the "geekvana", an inner peace state, which I learnt reading posts and posts through years.

Now I am declutting my computer and I want to share my own steps:

* simplicity
* dump everything on
* say no
* sleep
* declutter
* use reminders
* proactive
* focus
* don’t multitask (thinking about your next task or anything that worries you counts)
* be aware of time
  * less time (restrict yourself)
* allow interruptions (just handle them gently)
* pile tasks
  * pick one at random (upon priorities)
* automate everything (whenever possible)

If you want a better explanation about, ask me, but I recommend you reading first [Leo Babauta's The Power of Less](https://zenhabits.net/leos-book-the-power-of-less-video-and-website/), an awesome book.
