# A New Path

Today, coinciding with the anniversary of the November 28, 2010 elections and after fulfilling acquired commitments, I announce that a few weeks ago I left Pirates de Catalunya. This date is significant because these elections were the first in which Pirates participated, shortly after its official formation, and marked my first electoral experience.

In fourteen years I've had the opportunity to build an alternative, influencing public life in a historic context: from the 15M movement to the rise of Catalan independentism, through the repression of the Spanish State and the growth of the far right, ending in the whirlwind of war and climate change in which the world is immersed.

I've taken on multiple responsibilities that have made me grow more than I ever imagined on the day I filled out the Pirates membership form. I've led electoral lists, served as a councilor, and contributed to national and international projects, among many others.

None of this would have been possible without you all, the hundreds of people with whom I've had the privilege of sharing this journey. I sincerely thank each and every one of you for the trust, dedication, and hours you've invested at every moment.

Now, I close this chapter and begin a new one. I do so because I've decided to take on new personal and professional challenges. I will continue to engage in politics in a different way, mainly through my [personal](https://bsky.app/profile/dario.cat) [channels](https://mastodont.cat/@dario).

Pirates, continue the good work and the fight for our [shared ideals](https://lektu.com/l/pirates-de-catalunya/guia-de-navegants-per-un-mon-millor/17120). I hope to meet you again on this new path I'm embarking on. Farewell!
