> **Progress made:** creation of my own page under my personal domain and review of active logins.

As promised, [I'm writing down my progress](https://dario.im/en/posts/delete-facebook/). In the last days I have recovered my personal domain, which I'll use as my main profile. Its advantages don't come without disadvantages. I'll control my identity, combined with [Keybase](https://keybase.io) (more about this tool in another post), and the authorship of my texts, available under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. There are more advantages, but I don't want to extend myself. Before I must admit that this isn't available to everybody without falling into another walled garden, much less at no cost.

If you are curious, the web is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the theme [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/minimo/). [Repository available here](https://github.com/imdario/dario.im) for techies.

I have also reviewed what logins I have active. I have seen that there are 123. 123 external websites and mobile applications in which I log in using Facebook because it's easy. I also do it with Twitter. It's very easy but inconvenient. It's inconvenient for cases like the one we are dealing with, but the exercise serves to become aware of how easy it's to fall into the trap of utility instead of making decisions aimed at maintaining the personal sovereignty of your information.

Finally, a brief comment. This is leading me to think about how to solve the problem generated. We like to share our lives, either in person or digitally. Therefore, there is a need that has not yet found an optimal decentralized solution. I'll write more about it but I can advance that, although there are proposals in the right direction, they are all wrong in some way: either of wanting to be very innovative or solving all the possible problems or being focused on a specific software, no matter how free (as in freedom).

<u>I sincerely believe that there are already existing solutions and architectures to build a social network protocol to achieve the necessary freedom and privacy.</u>
