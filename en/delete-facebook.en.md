After the controversy of Cambridge Analytica, I have decided to stop feeding the beast, Facebook.

I also decided that I'm going to document my process, since it is not simply stop using it or abruptly closing my account.

Actually, I found it a rather complex process: I have many websites where I use Facebook as a login, there are people with whom I keep contact here exclusively, etc. So I'm not just gonna explain it so that others can do it, but I'll make you part of it.

And you, are you going to leave Facebook? If yes, where are you going? If it's no, why and how would you rather to keep in contact with me?
